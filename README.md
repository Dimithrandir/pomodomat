# pomodomat

A simple bash script to help focus while working using the pomodoro technique.

### Usage

Running without any parameters will start pomodomat with the default values: 3 sets of 3 pomodoro sessions lasting 20 minutes each, with 5 minute breaks and 15 minute long breaks.

Each of these values can be changed by providing arguments.

Best used with a keyboard shortcut.

### Installation 

Either `git clone` the repository or download `pomodomat` and the image files and add them to your `$PATH`.

If you move the images to another directory you will have to edit the script and add the new directory.

### Dependencies 

Uses `pulseaudio` to play notification sounds.
